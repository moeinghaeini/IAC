# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide for Little Cloud Architects! 🛠️

## 🚨 Common Problems and Solutions

### 🔧 Terraform Issues

#### Problem: "Terraform not found" error
**What it means:** Terraform isn't installed on your computer.

**Solution:**
```bash
# For Mac users:
brew install terraform

# For Windows users:
# Download from https://terraform.io/downloads.html

# For Linux users:
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.9.0/terraform_1.9.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.9.0_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Problem: "AWS credentials not found" error
**What it means:** Terraform can't connect to AWS.

**Solution:**
1. Ask a grown-up to help set up AWS credentials
2. Run: `aws configure`
3. Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

#### Problem: "Bucket already exists" error
**What it means:** Someone else already used that bucket name.

**Solution:**
- S3 bucket names must be unique worldwide
- Try adding your initials or a random number
- Example: `my-pizza-shop-abc123`

#### Problem: "Instance limit exceeded" error
**What it means:** You've created too many instances.

**Solution:**
1. Run `terraform destroy` to clean up
2. Wait a few minutes
3. Try again with fewer instances

### 🌐 Website Issues

#### Problem: Website shows "Access Denied"
**What it means:** Your S3 bucket isn't configured for public access.

**Solution:**
1. Check the bucket policy in your Terraform code
2. Make sure `block_public_acls = false`
3. Run `terraform apply` again

#### Problem: Website shows "This site can't be reached"
**What it means:** The website isn't running or there's a network issue.

**Solution:**
1. Check if the EC2 instance is running
2. Check the security group allows HTTP traffic
3. Wait a few minutes for the instance to start

#### Problem: Website loads but looks broken
**What it means:** The HTML code might have an error.

**Solution:**
1. Check the user_data script in your Terraform code
2. Make sure all HTML tags are properly closed
3. Test your HTML in a simple file first

### 💰 Cost Issues

#### Problem: Unexpected charges on AWS bill
**What it means:** Resources are still running and costing money.

**Solution:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run `terraform destroy`
2. Check AWS Console for any remaining resources
3. Delete any resources manually if needed
4. Always ask a grown-up before running `terraform apply`

#### Problem: "Free tier limit exceeded" error
**What it means:** You've used up your free tier allowance.

**Solution:**
1. Use smaller instance types (t3.micro)
2. Delete unused resources
3. Wait for the next month's free tier reset

### 🔒 Security Issues

#### Problem: "Permission denied" error
**What it means:** Your AWS user doesn't have the right permissions.

**Solution:**
1. Ask a grown-up to check your AWS permissions
2. Make sure you have EC2, S3, and VPC permissions
3. Consider using AWS IAM roles

#### Problem: Can't SSH into instance
**What it means:** Security group or key pair issues.

**Solution:**
1. Check if you have a key pair configured
2. Check security group allows SSH (port 22)
3. Make sure you're using the correct key file

### 🧪 Testing Issues

#### Problem: Tests fail with "timeout" error
**What it means:** Resources are taking too long to create.

**Solution:**
1. Increase the timeout in your test configuration
2. Check if AWS is experiencing issues
3. Try running tests during off-peak hours

#### Problem: Tests fail with "not found" error
**What it means:** Resources weren't created properly.

**Solution:**
1. Check Terraform logs for errors
2. Verify your AWS credentials
3. Make sure all required variables are set

## 🆘 Getting Help

### 📚 Self-Help Resources
1. **Read the error message carefully** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Check the Terraform documentation** - https://terraform.io/docs
3. **Look at AWS documentation** - https://docs.aws.amazon.com
4. **Search for your error message** on Google

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 When to Ask for Help
- If you're not sure what an error means

- If you can't figure out how to fix something
- If you're stuck for more than 30 minutes

### 🚨 Emergency Procedures

#### If you see unexpected charges:
1. **STOP** - Don't create any more resources
2. **DESTROY** - Run `terraform destroy` immediately
3. **CHECK** - Look at AWS Console for remaining resources
4. **ASK** - Get help from a grown-up right away

#### If your computer freezes:
1. **WAIT** - Give it a few minutes
2. **RESTART** - Restart your computer if needed
3. **CHECK** - See if resources were created
4. **CLEAN** - Run `terraform destroy` when you can

## 🎯 Prevention Tips

### ✅ Before Starting
- Always ask a grown-up for permission
- Make sure you understand the costs
- Have a plan for cleaning up
- Test with small resources first

### ✅ While Working
- Run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply`
- Check costs in AWS Console regularly
- Keep track of what you create
