# 🍕 Welcome to Tony's Pizza Shop! 🍕

Hi there, little chef! 👋 Today we're going to help Tony build his very own pizza delivery website! 

## 🎯 What We're Building

We're going to create:
- 🌐 A website where people can order pizza
- 🖥️ A computer server to run the website
- 🗄️ A place to store all the pizza orders
- 🔒 Security to keep everything safe

## 🧩 The Building Blocks

Think of this like building with LEGO blocks:

1. **🌐 Network** - Like the roads that connect everything
2. **🖥️ Computer** - The brain that runs our website
3. **🗄️ Database** - Where we store pizza orders
4. **🔒 Security** - The locks that keep everything safe

## 🚀 Let's Start Building!

### Step 1: Get Your Tools Ready
```bash
# This downloads all the tools we need (like getting your LEGO pieces!)
terraform init
```

### Step 2: See What We're Going to Build
```bash
# This shows you a preview of what we'll create (like looking at the LEGO instructions!)
terraform plan
```

### Step 3: Build It!
```bash
# This actually builds everything (like putting the LEGO pieces together!)
terraform apply
```

### Step 4: Clean Up When Done
```bash
# This removes everything when you're done playing (like putting LEGO back in the box!)
terraform destroy
```

## 🎨 What You'll Learn

- How to create a simple website
- How computers talk to each other
- How to store information safely
- How to keep everything secure

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notes

- Always ask a grown-up before running `terraform apply`
- Some of this might cost money, so check with your parents first!
- Always run `terraform destroy` when you're done to clean up
